# hello-world

Hi I'm a new beginner user hopping to learn more about coding and this community.
I work mainly on TouchDesigner, developing multimedia interactions and digital art.
I learned programming in highschool but then I quit programming for a long time, so I'm back trying to re learn everithing again ;).
